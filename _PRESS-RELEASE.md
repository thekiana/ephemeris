There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##

  Ephemeris is a meditation journal that predicts optimal meditation habits.

## Sub-Heading ##

  Ephemeris is a tool for meditators to gain awareness of their external enviornment and track the reactivity or responsivity of their thoughts to find their optimal meditation routine, so that not only can we meditate to find equanimity in our daily lives, but we can predict it.

## Summary ##

 Ephemeris is Latin for "journal". Dually, the Latin ephemerus is the root of the word "ephemeral". A maxim in meditation is that thoughts are ephemeral, and through this understanding we find our power over them. Whether a person's thoughts are reactive or responsive, there is often a correlation with external stressors and patterns. The goal of meditation is to become emotionally responsive and non-reactive. For example, road rage is a common source of emotional reactivity in even the most adept meditators, and we often get lost in unawareness. Ephemeris wants to show meditators that statistical insight can benefit their journey to spiritual insight. We use the data to predict the solution. Before meditating, a user can input their mood, their location (ex. commuting), the time of day, and optionally a journal entry to elaborate on their mood state. After meditating, their mood and these same insights can be recorded, including the type of meditation practiced (ex. vipassana) and the number of minutes spent meditating. The goal is for the user to both be aware of patterns and gain a statistical measurement of what meditation is best for their subjective experience, which the app will recommend to the user each day. Is there a sweet spot for how many minutes of meditation it takes a meditator to release their emotional reactivity and enter a calm, equanimous space? Ephemeris will analyze that and serve that to you.

## Problem ##

  The problem amongst meditators, especially beginners to the practice, is that we often wait until we have already begun to respond reactively to thoughts and stressors before engaging in mindful awareness or sitting down to the meditation chair. The sooner we are to becoming aware of our thoughts, the less we will give thoughts the power to enmesh our mind and become jumbles of definitive constructs. What better way to do that than with personalized, calculated predictions sent to you each day?
